# MasterProject2024

This repository contains the code and resources for my master's thesis project: "Application of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) Technology in Transcribing Norwegian Police Interviews."

## Project Overview

This master's thesis explores the application of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology, particularly the Whisper model, in transcribing Norwegian police interviews conducted in diverse environmental conditions. The project aims to address the impact of noise on the performance of the selected ASR models.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this research stems from the growing necessity for efficient and accurate digital tools in urban law enforcement. Manual transcription of interviews is a time-consuming task. The introduction of tools capable of automating the task of transcribing these interviews might reduce the time required to perform the transcription. However, the interviews are done in noisy environments. The interviews that are done on the spot contain a variety of background noise. This research seeks to enhance the understanding of Whisper ASR model’s performance in these noisy conditions.

## Contributions

This work makes three primary contributions:
1. Testing variations of Whisper’s ASR models fine-tuned for the Norwegian language.
2. Evaluating the performance of these models in environments typical of those encountered by law enforcement officers on a daily basis.
3. Quantifying and displaying the loss in performance depending on the level of noise in recordings containing speech.

## Research Questions

The core objective of this study is to assess and enhance the performance of speech-to-text (ASR) for police interviews in noisy environments. The research questions formulated to guide this study are:

1. **Evaluation of Norwegian ASR Models in Noisy Environments:** How do diverse environmental conditions, such as crowded streets and traffic noise, affect the accuracy of speech-to-text AI in transcribing Norwegian speech?
2. **Model Robustness Against Noise:** What is the robustness of speech-to-text technologies in handling various types of uncontrolled noise, especially in Norwegian speech contexts? What noise levels can an ASR model handle?
3. **Comparison of Real and Synthetic Noise:** How does the performance of speech-to-text AI in real noisy environments compare with its performance in synthetic noise conditions?

## Methodology

The methodology involves a series of controlled experiments and comparative analyses, including:
- **Data Collection:** Recording speech in naturally noisy environments and artificially introducing noise into clean speech recordings.
- **Model Evaluation:** Using Word Error Rate (WER) and Area Under Curve (AUC) as primary metrics to evaluate model performance under different noise conditions.

## Results

The results chapter presents the findings of the experiments, analyzing ASR performance in various noisy conditions with supporting graphs and tables. Detailed results and comparisons are provided for different models and noise levels.
